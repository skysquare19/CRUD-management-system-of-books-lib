Book Management System
This project is an implementation of a Book Management System, designed to manage a collection of books with functionalities for creating, reading, updating, and deleting book records. The system provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the book database and perform various operations related to book management.

Features:
Book CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new books to the database with details such as title, author, genre, publication date, and ISBN.
Read: View a list of all books in the database along with their details. Users can search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.
Update: Modify existing book records to update information such as title, author, genre, publication date, or ISBN.
Delete: Remove books from the database based on user selection.
Search and Filter:

Allow users to search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN to quickly find the desired book records.
Implement filtering options to refine search results based on specific criteria such as publication date or genre.
User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
Define user roles and permissions to control access to CRUD operations based on user privileges.
User-Friendly Interface:

Design an intuitive and responsive user interface for easy navigation and interaction with the system.
Provide feedback and notifications to users for successful CRUD operations or error messages.
Data Validation and Error Handling:

Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent incorrect or incomplete information from being saved to the database.
Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to guide users in resolving issues.
Data Persistence:

Utilize a database management system (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store book records persistently.
Implement data backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss and ensure data consistency.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Python with Django framework for handling server-side logic and database operations.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building the user interface and enhancing user experience.
Database: SQLite (for simplicity, can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability).
User Authentication: Django's built-in authentication system or third-party libraries like Django REST Framework Token Authentication.
Error Handling: Django's built-in error handling mechanisms and custom error pages for better user experience.
